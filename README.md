## Ramda game

Hello! This is a really early prototype on an idea I had. The final game will be browser based and will let you drag and drop Ramda functions to form the solutions (similar to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)).

This is just a very early version designed to get some feedback as quickly as possible. Please email me at <david@davidxmoody.com> with any and all feedback!

## How to play

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidxmoody/ramda-game.git
cd ramda-game
npm i
npm start
```

Then open up the file `playtest/level1.js` and start making some changes. The rules and objectives are described in that file. 

The `npm start` command will watch for changes and re-run the file each time. Keep trying until all the assertions pass!
